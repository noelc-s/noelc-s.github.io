At the moment, I'm very excited about the underlying structure of optimal control, and how it can be used to synthesize agile behaviors for legged systems. I am also interested in the theory of hierarchical control, and the use of control architechtures as a means of improving the efficiencly, feasiibility, and generalizability of autonomy stacks. Please feel free to reach me over email if these are similarly of interest to you!

<!-- At the moment, I'm very excited about the relationship between low level controllers and online planning algorithms, and the guarantees that can be made in a combined framework. I am also interested in the application of model predictive control as a tool to achieve bipedal locomotion, and how it can be paired with offline trajectory optimization to improve runtime efficiency and increase the complexity of behaviors.
