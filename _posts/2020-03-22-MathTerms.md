## Spaces
---
### Topological Space
Informally, a set of points, along with a set of neighbourhoods for each point satisfying a set of axioms relating points and neighbourhoods. Formally, let $X$ be a set, and let $\mathscr{U}$ be a collection of subsets of $X$. $\mathscr{U}$ is called a topology on X if
1. $X,\emptyset\in\mathscr{U}$;
2. $\\{U_{\alpha}\\}$, an arbitrary collection of elements of $\mathscr{U}$, implies that $\cup_{\alpha}U_\alpha\in\mathscr{U}$;
3. $\\{U_j \\}^n_{j=1}$, a finite collection of elements of $\mathscr{U}$, implies that $\cap_{j=1}^n U_j\in\mathscr{U}$

The pair $(X,\mathscr{U})$ is called a topological space, and the elements of $\mathscr{U}$ are called open sets.

### Metric Space
Informally, a metric space is a space imbued with a "sense of distance". Formally, let $X$ be a set. A function $d:X\times X\to\mathbb{R}$ is said to be a matric on $X$ if 
1. $d(u,v)\ge0$ for all $u,v\in X$, and $d(u,v)=0$ if and only if $u=v$;
2. $d(u,v)=d(v,u)$ for all $u,v\in X$; and
3. $d(u,v)\le d(u,w)+d(w,v)$ for all $u,v,w\in X$.

The pair $(X,d)$ is called a metric space.

### Dual Space
Any vector space $V$ has a corresponding dual vector space, $V^\*$, consisting of all linear functionals on V. Formally, given any vector space $V$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$, the (algebraic) dual space $V^*$ is the set of all linear maps $\varphi:V\to\mathbb{F}$.

## Topology-esque

### Morphism
A morphism is a structure-preserving map between mathematical structures of the same type.
### Endomorphism
A morphism from an object to itself. An endomorphism that is also an isomorphism is an automorphism.
#### Example
The orthogonal projection onto a line is an endomorphism on the plane which is not an automorphism.
### Isomorphism
A bijective morphism.
### Homomorphism
A mapping between two algebraic objects, which preserves operation in those objects. 
### Homeomorphism
A continuous topological isomorphism. In other words, it is a continuous function between topological spaces with continuous inverse.
### Diffeomorphism
A differentiable homeomorphism, i.e. a continuously differentiable mapping between topological spaces with continuously differentiable inverse.
### Examples
Let $(G, * )$ and $(H,\cdot)$ be two groups. A group homomorphism is a map $\rho:G\to H$ that satisfies $\rho (a*b)=\rho(a)\cdot \rho(b)$. If $\rho$ is bijective, then it is a group isomorphism. In this case, $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic, written as $G\cong H$.

## Differential Geometry
---
### [Manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold)
Informally, a manifold is a "surface", i.e. a space that is locally Euclidean. Formally, a (topological) manifold is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space.
### [Foliage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foliation)
An equivalence relation on an $n$-manifold, the equivalence classes being connected, injectively immersed submanifolds, all of the same dimension $p$, modeled on the decomposition of the real coordinate space $\mathbb{R}^n$ into the cosets $x+\mathbb{R}^p$ of the standardly embedded subspace $\mathbb{R}^p$.
### [Fiber Bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_bundle#Examples)
Informally, a fiber bundle is locally a product space, but globally may have a different topological structure. If the fiber bundle is just a product space, it is known as the trivial bundle. 
#### Sections of Fiber Bundles
Let $B$ be the base space, $F$ be the fiber, and $E$ be the total space of the fiber bundle. A section of the fiber bundle $E$ is given by a continuous map $\sigma:B\to E$ such that $\pi(\sigma(x))=x$ for all $x\in B$. A section of the tangent bundle $TM$ is a vector field on $M$.
#### Examples
Consider the base space $B=\mathbb{S}^1$, the Fiber $F=\mathbb{R}$, and the trivial bundle $E=B\times F$, which manifests itself as a cylinder. An example of a nontrivial fiber bundle with the same form would be the M\"obius strip. If instead $F=\mathbb{S}^1$, the trivial bundle would be the torus and the klein bottle would be an example of a nontrivial bundle.
### Vector Bundle
A fiber bundle whose fibers are vector spaces.
### Tangent Bundle
The tangent bundle to a manifold $M$ is a manifold $TM$ that is the disjoint union of the tangent spaces of $M$. The tangent bundle is the prototypical example of a vector bundle.
### Cotangent Bundle
The dual bundle of the Tangent Bundle, conistent of all of the cotangent spaces at every point in the manifold.
### Lie Derivative
The Lie derivative evaluates the change of a tensor field along the flow defined by another vector field.
#### Example
$\dot{V}=\frac{dV}{dx}\dot{x}$ represents the Lie derivative of the scalar field $V$ (Lyapunov function) along the flow defined by the vector field given by the dynamics of a system.
### [Distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(differential_geometry))
A distribution is a collection of subspaces of the tangent bundle assigned to every point on a manifold. That is, for every point $x\in M$, we assign an $n$-dimensional subspace $\Delta_x\subset T_xM$, which depends smoothly on $x$ and have constant dimension for all $x$.
#### [Involutivity](https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Involutive_distribution)
A distribution $\Delta$ is involutive if for any two vector fields $X,Y\in \Delta$, $[X,Y]\in \Delta$
Examples:
Take $M=\mathbb{R}^3$ and coordinates $(x,y,z)$. Consider the distribution $\Delta=\left\\{\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right\\}$. Because $[X,X]=0$ for any vector field $X$, we simply need to notice that $\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right]=0\in\Delta$ to conclude that $\Delta$ is involutive. Instead, consider $\Delta=\left\\{\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right\\}$. Now,
\\[
\begin{align}
\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right] &= \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right]+\cancelto{0}{\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right]} \notag \\\\ 
&=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right) - \cancelto{0}{x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)} \notag \\\\ 
&= \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \notag
\end{align}
\\]
We require this to be a linear combination of the elements of $\Delta$; however, note that
\\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial y} = a\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+b\left(x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)
\\]
does not hold for any functions $a,b$ and therefore $\Delta$ is not involutive.
#### Integrability 
A submanifold $N$ of $M$ is said to be an integrable manifold of $\Delta$ if $T_xN=\Delta$ for any $x\in N$. $\Delta$ is said to be completely integrable if there exists an integral manifold of $\Delta$ through every point $x\in M$.
### Lie Bracket
The Lie derivative of a vector field with respect to another vector field. The lie bracket assigns any two vector fields $X4 and $Y$ on a smooth manifold $M$ a third vector field, denoted $[X,Y]$.

## Group Theory
### Magma/Groupoid
A set equipped with a binary operation which sends any two elements to another element, and satisfies closure, i.e. for all $x,y\in S$, $x\cdot y\in S$.
### Semigroup
A magma with associativity.
### Quasigroup 
A magma with divisibility.
### Monoid
A semigroup with the identity.
### Loop 
A quasigroup with the identity.

### Group
A group is a set, $G$ equipped with a binary operation $\cdot$ which satisfies the group axioms, given by
1. Closure: $\forall\ a,b\in G,\ a\cdot b\in G$
2. Associativity: $\forall\ a,b,c\in G, (a\cdot b)\cdot c = a\cdot (b\cdot c)$
3. Identity Element: $\exists\ e\in G\ s.t.\ \forall\ a\in G, e\cdot a=a\cdot e = a$
4. Inverse Element: $\forall\ a\in G,\ \exists\ b\in G s.t. a\cdot b = b\cdot a = e$

In the above terms, it is a magma which satisfies the group axioms.

### Abelian ($\equiv$ Commutative) Group
A group for which the group operation is commutative.

### Group Action
If $G$ is a group and $X$ is a set, then a (left) group action $\phi$ of G on X is a function 
\\[
\phi:G\times X\to X, (g,x)\to\phi(g,x)
\\]
that satisfies identity and compatability.

### Lie Group
A group whose elements are organized continuously and smoothly. A real Lie group is a group that is a finite-dimensional real smooth manifold, in which the group operations of multiplication and inversion are smooth maps. 

#### Example
Consider the group $S$ of continuous rotations about the origin, and the group $D_4$ of 90 degree rotations (i.e. the respective sets of rotations with the binary operation of composition). Now consider two objects, the square and the circle. $D_4$ constitutes a group action on the square, and $S$ constitutes a group action on the circle, because they preserve the symmetry of the underlying sets. Because the elements of $S$ are continuous, it is a Lie Group.


### Lie Groupoid 
Informally, a Lie groupois is a "many-object generalization" of a Lie group. A Lie groupoid is a groupoid where the set of objects $Ob$ and the set of morphisms $Mor$ are both manifolds, the source and target operations $s,t:Mor\to Ob$ are submersions, and the category operations are smooth.

## Abstract Algebra
---

### Ring
A ring is a set equipped with two binary operations that generalize the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. More rigorously, a ring is a set $\mathbf{R}$ equipped with two binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$ satisfying the ring axioms, given by
1. $\mathbf{R}$ is an abelian group under addition
2. $\mathbf{R}$ is a monoid under multiplication
3. Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition

### [Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics))
A module over a ring is a generalization of the notion of a vector space over a fieds, wherein the corresponding scalars are the elemnts of a given ring, and multiplication is defined between elements of the ring and elements of the module.

### [Algebra over a Field (Algebra)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field)
A vector space equipped with a bilinear product. Thus, an algebra is an algebraic structure, which consists of a set, together with operations of multiplication, addition, and scalar multiplication by elements of the underlying field, and satisfies the axioms implied by "vector space" and "bilinear".

### Lie Algebra
A Lie Algebra is a vector space $\mathfrak{g}$ with a Lie bracket. Any Lie group gives ruse to a Lie algebra, which is its tangent space at the identity.

### Lie Algebroid
Lie algebroids serce the same role for Lie groupoids that Lie algebras serve for Lie groups.
