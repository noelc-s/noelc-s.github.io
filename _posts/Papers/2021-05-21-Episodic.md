## Overview
Learning a residual term on a dynamics model to ensure safety via barrier functions.

## Abstract
This paper combines episodic learning and control barrier functions in the setting of bipedal lo-
comotion. The safety guarantees that control barrier functions provide are only valid with perfect
model knowledge; however, this assumption cannot be met on hardware platforms. To address this,
we utilize the notion of projection-to-state safety paired with a machine learning framework in an
attempt to learn the model uncertainty as it affects the barrier functions. The proposed approach is
demonstrated both in simulation and on hardware for the AMBER-3M bipedal robot in the context
of the stepping-stone problem, which requires precise foot placement while walking dynamically.
