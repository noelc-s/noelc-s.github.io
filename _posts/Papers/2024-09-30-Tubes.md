## Overview
Learning tracking invariant tubes using IsaacGym.

## Abstract
Safe navigation of cluttered environments is a
critical challenge in robotics. It is typically approached by
separating the planning and tracking problems, with planning
executed on a reduced order model to generate reference trajec-
tories, and control techniques used to track these trajectories on
the full order dynamics. Inevitable tracking error necessitates
robustification of the nominal plan to ensure safety; in many
cases, this is accomplished via worst-case bounding, which
ignores the fact that some trajectories of the planning model
may be easier to track than others. In this work, we present a
novel method leveraging massively parallel simulation to learn
a dynamic tube representation, which characterizes tracking
performance as a function of actions taken by the planning
model. Planning model trajectories are then optimized such
that the dynamic tube lies in the free space, allowing a balance
between performance and safety to be traded off in real time.
The resulting Dynamic Tube MPC is applied to the 3D hopping
robot ARCHER, enabling agile and performant navigation
of cluttered environments, and safe collision-free traversal of
narrow corridors.
