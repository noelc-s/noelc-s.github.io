## Overview
A planner-tracker framework with guarantees.

## Abstract
Modern control systems must operate in increasingly
complex environments subject to safety constraints and input
limits, and are often implemented in a hierarchical fashion with
different controllers running at multiple time scales. Yet tra-
ditional constructive methods for nonlinear controller synthesis
typically “flatten” this hierarchy, focusing on a single time scale,
and thereby limited the ability to make rigorous guarantees on
constraint satisfaction that hold for the entire system. In this
work we seek to address the stabilization of constrained nonlinear
systems through a multi-rate control architecture. This is accom-
plished by iteratively planning continuous reference trajectories
for a nonlinear system using a linearized model and Model
Predictive Control (MPC), and tracking said trajectories using
the full-order nonlinear model and Control Lyapunov Functions
(CLFs). Connecting these two levels of control design in a way
that ensures constraint satisfaction is achieved through the use
of Bézier curves, which enable planning continuous trajectories
respecting constraints by planning a sequence of discrete points.
Our framework is encoded via convex optimization problems
which may be efficiently solved, as demonstrated in simulation.
