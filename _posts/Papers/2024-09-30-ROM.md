## Overview
Safety-critical control using reduced order models.

## Abstract
Reduced-order models (ROMs) provide lower di-
mensional representations of complex systems, capturing their
salient features while simplifying control design. Building on
previous work, this paper presents an overarching framework
for the integration of ROMs and control barrier functions,
enabling the use of simplified models to construct safety-critical
controllers while providing safety guarantees for complex full-
order models. To achieve this, we formalize the connection
between full and ROMs by defining projection mappings that
relate the states and inputs of these models and leverage
simulation functions to establish conditions under which safety
guarantees may be transferred from a ROM to its corre-
sponding full-order model. The efficacy of our framework is
illustrated through simulation results on a drone and hardware
demonstrations on ARCHER, a 3D hopping robot.
