## Overview
Design and control of a back exoskeleton.

## Abstract
An exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides an exosuit support system, comprising first and second orthotic interfaces, first and second members, and first and second actuators. The first and second orthotic interfaces can be configured to attach to left and right legs of a user, respectively. The first member can comprise a first end connected to the first orthotic interface and a second end connected to a portion of the system configured to be positioned proximate a right shoulder of the user. The second member can comprise a first end connected to the second orthotic interface and a second end connected to a portion of the system configured to be positioned proximate a left shoulder of the user. The first actuator can be configured to apply a first tension to the first member. The second actuator can be configured to apply a second tension to the second member.
