## Overview
Using an omnidirectional treadmill to control passive armatures.

## Abstract
The control of passive dynamic systems remains a
challenging problem in the field of robotics, and insights from
their study can inform everything from dynamic behaviors on
actuated robots to robotic assistive devices. In this work, we
explore the use of flat actuated environments for realizing pas-
sive dynamic balancing and locomotion. Specifically, we utilize
a novel omnidirectional actuated floor to dynamically stabilize
two robotic systems. We begin with an inverted pendulum to
demonstrate the ability to control a passive system through an
active environment. We then consider a passive bipedal robot
wherein dynamically stable periodic walking gaits are generated
through an optimization that leverages the actuated floor. The
end result is the ability to demonstrate passive dynamic walking
experimentally through the use of actuated environments.
