## Overview
Using the saltation matrix to improve robustness of gait generation.

## Abstract
The ability to generate robust walking gaits on
bipedal robots is key to their successful realization on hard-
ware. To this end, this work extends the method of Hybrid
Zero Dynamics (HZD) – which traditionally only accounts for
locomotive stability via periodicity constraints under perfect
impact events – through the inclusion of the saltation matrix
with a view toward synthesizing robust walking gaits. By jointly
minimizing the norm of the extended saltation matrix and the
torque of the robot directly in the gait generation process, we
demonstrate that the synthesized gaits are more robust than
gaits generated with either term alone; these results are shown
in simulation and on hardware for the AMBER-3M planar
biped and the Atalante lower-body exoskeleton (both with and
without a human subject). The end result is experimental
validation that combining saltation matrices with HZD methods
produces more robust bipedal walking in practice.
