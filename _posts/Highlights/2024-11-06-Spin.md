Spin, spin, spin\
Breath in, breathe out\
Spin, spin, spin\
Up down, up down\
Spin, spin, spin

Oh my goodness, what a glorious day it is\
Hugged (nearly smothered) by the afternoon sun\
Feeling the wind\
Feeling the power\
Spin, spin, spin

"Could I have a macchiato please?"\
"And that banana bread looks delightful"\
Knowing where you've been\
Knowing where you're going\
Spin, spin, spin

A pleasant repose from the business of thought\
Is the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;emptiness &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of a long ride\
Trading mental effort for physical\
On the road to anywhere\
Spin, spin, spin
